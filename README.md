# Dynamic PR Templates

## GitHub App for Streamlined Pull Request Workflows

Dynamic PR Templates is a productivity tool that automatically applies the right template to your pull requests based on the PR title prefix. This helps maintain consistency across your team's pull requests while saving time on repetitive formatting.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Setup**: When added to a repository, the app creates standardized PR templates in your `.github` directory.

2. **Prefix-Based Templates**: Simply add a prefix in square brackets to your PR title (e.g., `[FEATURE]` or `[BUG_FIX]`) and the app will automatically apply the corresponding template to your PR description. **The prefix inside the brackets and file name is CASE SENSITIVE**

3. **Customizable Templates**: Edit the templates in your `.github/pr_templates/` directory to match your team's workflow and requirements.

### Benefits for Developers

- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform pull request documentation across your projects
- **Efficiency**: Focus on code instead of formatting PR descriptions
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members follow established practices
- **Flexibility**: Create custom templates for different types of changes
